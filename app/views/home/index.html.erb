                                    Here at wellbe we believe there are non-chemical, noninvasive solutions to many health issues today that can provide more than just an indefinite bandaid.  The trouble is, there is a lot of noise out there. There is plenty of bad information and the good information is often buried in random places most consumers cannot or don't know how to find. The internet has allowed us to not just take a doctor's word as fact, we can now research and understand all of our options and make better decisions.

                                    We think wellbe can change the healthcare system in some small way by aggregating natural, complementary and alternative healthcare information as well as general wellness, nutritional and lifestyle tips from a variety of notable sources and by providing a community platform for people dedicated to living a more natural life. By sharing your health stories and your health questions, the wellbe network can help answer your questions and solve your health challenges. From medical databases to NYTimes Health articles, we'll comb through the noise and provide you with as comprehensive a view as we can of all your options.
